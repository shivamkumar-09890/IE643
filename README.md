# Project Allotted: Conditioned Replacement of Specific Words in Hindi Language Videos with Corresponding Lip-Sync

## Task Description
You would be developing a model which will allow a user to replace specific words in Hindi language videos with other user-provided words with corresponding lip-sync in the video clips. Note that the replacement has to happen at all occurrences of the words and should not impact the other words.

### Objectives:
1. **Collect relevant datasets** that can be used for the task. If labeling is required, the team must perform the labeling.
2. **Explore existing approaches** that can be adapted for this task. Collect any relevant pretrained models that can be used.
3. **Design a suitable deep neural net model architecture** that aligns with the data collected. Consider memory constraints when deciding on your model choice and during training.
4. **Design suitable performance metrics** that can quantify the goodness of the replacement and lip-sync characteristics.
5. **Implement your ideas** to achieve the task.
6. **Prepare an interface** where your results can be effectively showcased.

## Deliverables/Expectations:
1. **Trained/Finetuned Model:** All trained/finetuned models, code files with necessary documentation, and a description of dependencies and usage.
2. **User Interface:** An interface where the user can input a video clip and words to be replaced with corresponding replacements.
3. **Comparison Interface:** An interface where the user can view the original and edited videos side by side to assess qualitative model performance.
4. **Performance Metrics:** Display metrics that quantify the experiment's success, focusing on the accuracy of word replacement and the quality of lip-sync for replaced words.
5. **Extensive Stage-Wise Report:** This report should include justifications for the steps taken during the project, details on major experiments, datasets used, and steps for dataset extraction. It should also outline the methodology for preparing the interface (if developed). Additional report instructions will be provided later.
